While there is still cardamom,<br>
while there are yet eggs cooling for the dog,<br>
while there is coffee through the percolator,<br>
inhale deeply. Ingest. Breathe joy.<br>
Call the family to table together,<br>
say your grace, hold fast to that which is good.

The shadows are lengthening.<br>
Narrow men are tapping for his due<br>
who shouts alone to the dark in darkened rooms,<br>
growls before dawn, unable to feel loved.<br>
Be alert for the holy unfinished:<br>
plant your feet, stand where you have always stood.

While there are still cardinals,<br>
while the grocer still forces yellow tulips,<br>
while there is fresh grass and the earthiness<br>
of geraniums, go ahead, live.<br>
Return to no one evil for evil,<br>
love the sun, bed the world in moss and truth.

The cheats are licking their lips.<br>
They move fast and never look back, never.<br>
They want you separated and asking Please.<br>
You should say no. Refuse.<br>
Leave room for the wrath, say what is right,<br>
but don't tell it scant: make it absolute.
