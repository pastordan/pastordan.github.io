If you haven't seen it (and why would you?), I've started <a href="http://www.strangerjesus.com/">a podcast</a>, because duh, middle-aged hipster wannabe.

Anyway, the podcast is about finding the good news in unexpected places, interviews on current topics, music, and weird little bits of worship. Find out how to follow the show above, or <a href="https://mailchi.mp/8e18f656201a/stranger-jesus-e-newsletter"></a> sign up for the newsletter to be alerted to new episodes, or get weekly sermons, prayers, and reflections in your inbox.

DO IT.
