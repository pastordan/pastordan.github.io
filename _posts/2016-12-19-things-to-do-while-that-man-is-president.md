*Just after the election, while I and all my liberal friends were down in the dumps, I got tired of just waiting for the worst to happen. So I put together a little (ha, ha) list of things we could do instead. At my friend Marcy's request, I'm pulling it together for spreading around purposes. You're welcome to send suggestions/additions if you like.  You should also read [Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DzOz3Y6D8g_MNXHNMJYAz1b41_cn535aU5UsN7Lj8X8/preview).*

Let’s see. I bet I can come up with 20 things you can do to make life better under Trump, instead of rolling over and playing dead.

1. Show kindness, especially to people you wouldn’t normally. Notice the homeless; reach out to a conservative relative.

2. Help someone register to vote. Start now, while there’s plenty of time to negotiate the maze.

3. Write a letter to Hillary Clinton, thanking her for her effort. Same with Obama. Write to Joe Biden and tell him he’s been a bitchin’ VP.

4. Celebrate relationships of your gay & lesbian friends. If you know someone who is transsexual, tell them you accept them for themselves.

5. Tell everyone you know that you won’t stand for hateful attacks. I’ve already told my congregation, and will my classes.

6. If there is some act of hate in your area, let everyone know you condemn it in the strongest possible terms. Say it loudly.

7. Visit a mosque near you. Pray with the community. Tell them you are proud to be associated with them. Mean it.

10. Eat at a Mexican restaurant and leave a big tip. Write "Fuck Donald Trump" on the receipt.

11. Celebrate Cinco de Mayo or attend a seder dinner, if you’re invited.

12. Get into woke and socially-aware music, especially in all-white areas. I like to blast Norteño and Mexican hip-hop in the country.

13. Work in a soup kitchen or volunteer at a food pantry. It needs to be done anyway, even more now.

14. A couple of hard one: if you don’t like mega-corporate banks, join a credit union. Help start one for underserved neighborhoods.

15. Foster a child. Welcome that little stranger into your home and love them, deeply.

16. If you’re part of a church, work to make sure it’s open and affirming, welcoming to all people. Make sure that shows up in worship.

17. Teach your children to reject hate. Encourage them to be leaders in standing up to bullies and bigots.

18. Take your daughter to a self-defense class. Teach her how to be safe. Teach your son to respect women & prevent others from harming them

19. If you live in a mostly white area, especially if rural, talk about your experiences outside the neighborhood. Highlight diversity.

20. If somebody tells a racist or sexist joke in your presence, tell them you don’t like humor that hurts people. When they say "What’s the matter, can’t you take a joke?" don’t get angry. Tell them how sad and hurt it makes you feel.

21. If you want to be a little more partisan/political, when somebody mentions how the little guy is getting screwed by big companies, point out how Trump is in bed with those same companies. Wouldn’t it be nice if someone would actually help someone like you?

22. Along the lines of 18 ☝︎, if somebody says, "Thank God we don’t have be politically correct anymore!" Tell them you prefer not to be hurtful with your language.

23. Don’t be ashamed to read books by minority/gay authors. Same with films, TV, music. You like Blackish or Modern Family? Let people know!

24. More hard ones: shelter an undocumented immigrant. Help resettle a refugee. Help a young woman get an abortion.

25. Keep the pressure on for Black Lives Matter. Post bail for someone arrested in a protest. Buy them a gas mask, if need be.

26. Take a chance on employing somebody who’s served time in prison.

27. In addition to giving money to [Planned Parenthood](https://secure.ppaction.org/Donate/Defend‎) and the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/donate/join-renew-give), among others, support a blogger or independent journalist.

28. If you’re the praying sort, pray for yourself, and for forgiveness for your political opponents. Shut up. Do it anyway. Go to church. Participate in and support the community. Civil society is *important*.

29. Volunteer on a reservation. Remind yourself of what your priorities should be, and who deserves your support.

30. Make a friend outside your usual social circle. Stick with them even if things get tough, politically.

31. Finishing up: if you’d like to hang out with Muslims, see if you can wangle an invitation to an iftar dinner. They are *amazing.*

32. If fostering a child isn’t your thing, mentor a kid, or volunteer in a class. Love the little bastards.

33. In any case, you get the idea. The worst victory the alt-right could win would be to make the US a meaner, more divided place.

34. Refuse to allow yourself to be shut off from others, foster connections wherever you can, celebrate diversity. Remain human, publicly.

35. At the same time, if you need alternatives to the system, build them, or fund them, quietly. Fuck the man.

36. I’ll bet you all could come up with 50 more. :-)

37. Oh, but one more: Never tweet. Don't make lists, either.
