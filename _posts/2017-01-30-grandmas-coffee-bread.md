In a perhaps futile effort to show that normal life does go on despite a national political life that resembles nothing so much as a Hieronymous Bosch painting, here's a coffee bread (coffeecake) recipe inherited from my grandmother:

- 1&#189;-1&#190; cups milk
- 1 cup butter
- 3/4 sugar
- 1 package yeast / 1 T.
- 1 cup raisins
- 2 eggs
- 5-6 cups flour
- 1 t. cardamom
- 1 t. salt
- citron, candied orange, or lemon to suit

Warm the milk for about a minute-and-a-half in the microwave and add butter and sugar. (I usually slice the butter, or you can melt it and pour it in.) Let stand until lukewarm. Dissolve yeast in a little water.

Add cardamom and salt to flour. Beat two eggs and add to milk mixture, along with yeast and water, then pour it all into the flour. Mix together with raisins and other fruit. Beat well. Put in a warm place and let rise until doubled.

Pour into two greased cake pans. Top with sugar and cinnamon (go nuts, you'll wind up with less than you think) and let rise again.

Bake in moderate oven (350&deg;) for about 30 minutes. (Mom adds a note: "You will have to test the time&mdash;it maybe 35 minutes or more&mdash;Grandma didn't have a cooking time with her recipe.")

And there you have it! Serve it up with butter and strong dark coffee. It's perfect for beating the winter blahs.
