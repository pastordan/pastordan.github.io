From the [Little Office of Mary](http://www.liturgies.net/Liturgies/Catholic/LittleOffice.htm):

<em>The Lord turns his face against the wicked<br>
to destroy their remembrance from the earth. <br>
The Lord turns his eyes to the just<br>
and his ears to their appeal.

<em>They call and the Lord hears<br>
and rescues them in all their distress.<br>
The Lord is close to the broken-hearted; <br>
those whose spirit is crushed he will save.<br>

<em>Many are the trials of the just man<br>
but from them all the Lord will rescue him. <br>
He will keep guard over all his bones,<br>
not one of his bones shall be broken.

<em>Evil brings death to the wicked;<br>
those who hate the good are doomed.<br>
The Lord ransoms the souls of his servants.<br> 
Those who hide in him shall not be condemned.</em> <br>
&mdash;Psalm 34

**Concluding prayer:**<br>
Lord, make the peace we pray for a reality: may we live our days in quiet joy and, with the help of the Virgin Maryâ€™s prayers, safely reach your kingdom.
Grant this through Christ our Lord. **Amen.**
