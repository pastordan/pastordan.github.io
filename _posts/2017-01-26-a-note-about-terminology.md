You may have noticed, as in the last post, that I tend to avoid using terms like "resist" or "resistance." Mostly, this is just personal preference. It's easy to get overblown with comparisons to the French fighting the Nazis, and I'm just not that into Star Wars.

In general, I'd rather use "disobey" and "disobedience." It has a nice truculent ring to it, and it gets at the idea of going your own way rather than doing as you're told. I like to think in particular of refusing to go along with orders like: Be afraid, Hate, Don't think, Don't trust, Don't question the president.

This is probably not the most important thing, but it is my thing, and I wanted it on the record. So there you have it: disobey.
