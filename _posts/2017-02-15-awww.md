Here's a poem Jen commissioned from the Marian English students for Valentine's Day. All scansion and punctuation as is.

**To My Valentine, Dan**

When we play the insult game,<sup id="a1">[1](#fn1)</sup><br />
sometimes you win, sometimes<br />
I do, but you<br />
will always be my favorite adversary.

If you were a beer, hops would be too flowery<br />
or too bitter. You're no carb-light Miller 64, watered down<br />
and weak. The snob in you would want to be<br />
an Alaskan Amber.<sup id="a2">[2](#fn2)</sup> And just this once, I'd agree.

Although each year I toss your closet, discarding<br />
what you haven't work&mdash;whether you agree or not&mdash;you're<br />
the one thing I'd never discard.

Well, you & Taco.<sup id="a3">[3](#fn3)</sup>

I still marvel at being a Pastor's wife, on the every other Sunday<br />
I'm reminded I am, sitting<br />
in the pew.

So, Valentine, I'll order a pint of you,<br />
I'll keep you, I'll sing you, I'll insult<br />
you, with love.<sup id="a4">[4](#fn4)</sup>

<b id="fn1">1.</b>[↩](#a1) A game in which players attempt to one-up the other with increasingly nasty, vile, and depraved insults until their opponent is left utterly flabbergasted and unable to continue. Often played on road trips on the Ohio Turnpike where there's no good radio.<br />
<b id="fn2">2.</b>[↩](#a2) This detail provided by a colleague's husband from the last time I was at their house, almost a year ago. Actually, I'd be more of a barleywine or Imperial Stout, but good remembering.<br />
