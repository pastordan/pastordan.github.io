        <title>Cristo Rey turns out to be a pretty popular church name, actually</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=346696366&quot;&gt;Luke 1:68-79&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years back, I spent a weekend in Los Angeles. I spoke at a large congregation up in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas, large enough that their chapel is in a separate building, itself big enough to accommodate my current congregation's entire sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also went to visit the new cathedral of the Catholic archdiocese of Los Angeles, right in downtown LA. It's built on a truly monumental scale, like what I imagine the cathedrals in Europe must look like, albeit in and archly postmodern form. Yet it's an oddly intimate space as well, with small side chapels and a nave that allows regular members of the congregation to sit near the archbishop or whoever is presiding at worship that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was late in the day when I visited. The lights were mostly off, and the building almost empty. There were just a few other tourists and myself, and an organist playing the enormous pipe organ. It was peaceful and meditative, but also a bit lonely, a bit lifeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was killing time before a dinner date, so I walked down to Olvera Street, the historic center of the city. There is an adobe mission church there called Nuestra Señora Reina de Los Angeles, called &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://laplacita.org/&quot;&gt;La Placita&lt;/a&gt;&quot; because it used to be the little church on the plaza. I want to tell you about La Placita.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Spanish-language mass was going on in their historic chapel, so I stopped in. As it turns out, I got there just in time for the passing of the peace, and wound up shaking hands with several of the parishioners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't want to make out like I was suddenly adopted into this community. But it was a warm welcome. You could tell that this passing of the peace went beyond just a ritual. Several of the guys I &quot;met&quot; went out of their way to shake hands with as many people as they could. They couldn't have known all of us. And this being downtown LA, all kinds of people had collected there: homeless people, people in wheelchairs, people who were quite obviously tourists like myself. Nobody batted an eye. Whoever was there, was there, and they didn't seem to mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mass wound up pretty quickly, but afterwards a group of laypeople said the rosary in Spanish, which was fascinating to watch. I was so intrigued by the experience that when I ran into some unexpected free time on Sunday morning, I decided to come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you have to understand that even late on a Friday, La Placita is a busy place. They have a little courtyard where people come and hang out. On the other side of the courtyard there are offices with a variety of service agencies: there's a health clinic, a homeless ministry, a youth outreach program, a bookstore, a place for immigrants and a group that advocates for immigration reform. So there's people in and out all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning, the place is an absolute zoo. In addition to everything I've already mentioned, there's a cart where you can buy a gift or a rosary, and two stands where you can get a snack: ice cream or a taco. Guess where I ate lunch?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big sanctuary, which holds at least five hundred people, was filled to capacity. I went to the noon mass, and it was standing room only. So I stood, looking out of place in my blazer. They hold nine masses on a Sunday, three on Saturday, and I'm told that they are always packed. Kids everywhere, and some grandmas who are not afraid to tell them to shush from three rows back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if all that weren't enough, they have a brass band providing the music. They have two tubas, two trumpets, a trombone, a leader who plays the oboe, plus some various woodwinds and percussion instruments. They were loud and very fun. Can we have two tubas in our church? I would like two tubas in our church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more thing: outside, along one wall, is a mural of the Virgin Mary, and any time, day or night, there are people there lighting candles or leaving flowers and praying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was and am completely smitten by the place. I keep suggesting family vacations in LA, mostly because I want to go back to La Placita. It has become a model for me of a church that actually dares to proclaim Christ as King.  What does Zechariah sing today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,&lt;br /&gt; 
because he has come to his people and redeemed them. &lt;br /&gt; 
He has raised up a horn of salvation for us &lt;br /&gt; 
   in the house of his servant David &lt;br /&gt; 
(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),&lt;br /&gt; 
   salvation from our enemies &lt;br /&gt; 
   and from the hand of all who hate us.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All churches exist to serve a community, some rich, some poor. The church I spoke at is next door to a large retirement community for pastors and missionaries. They need to be large to accommodate their community. The cathedral is magnificent because that's what cathedrals do, especially in enormous cities like Los Angeles. It’s the headquarters of &lt;em&gt;5 million&lt;/em&gt; Catholics. You need a big clubhouse for that many parishioners. And La Placita does what it needs to do to meet the needs of its people. They are able to proclaim to these poor and working-class immigrants that God cares about them. God cares about their health, God cares about their immigration status, God cares about their children, God cares about the homeless in their midst, God seeks justice on their behalf, God seeks to lift them out of poverty and racial discrimination. What it means to them to proclaim Christ as King is to proclaim a King who cares very deeply and very intimately about what happens to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the people among whom Christ is really king. They prayed hard to him and his mother Mary because they needed him. Christ is king because he is poor. He is king because he is powerless. He knows these people because he’s been them. And it’s in just such a place, in a courtyard between a taco stand and an ice cream booth, jammed with girls in their Sunday dresses, babies, stressed-out parents, the common, humble people of the world, next to the homeless ministry and medical clinic, just down from the shrine to Mary, that Christ’s kingdom emerges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, people have wanted to say that should Christ return, the apocalypse will be glitzed to death by televangelists. It's an okay joke, but the truth is far more interesting to me. Christ will appear in the midst of the poor and the poorer, far away from the centers of power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For middle-class American believers to proclaim Christ as King means something very different. Most of us are not poor. Most of us are not immigrants. We don't need a welcoming, supportive community in the same way that the folks at La Placita do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet we do need a welcoming, supportive community. We do need to know that God cares about us, cares about what happens to our lives. The challenge in proclaiming Christ the King is to understand that we too need God, to understand that God can make a difference in our lives too. It is to understand that we too are a part of the covenant that God makes with Israel. We may not be poor, we may not be immigrants, but we too can see ourselves in Zechariah's words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;&lt;br /&gt;
   for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him, &lt;br /&gt;
   to give his people the knowledge of salvation &lt;br /&gt;
   through the forgiveness of their sins,
because of the tender mercy of our God,  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
   by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
   to shine on those living in darkness &lt;br /&gt;
   and in the shadow of death, &lt;br /&gt;
to guide our feet into the path of peace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I found at La Placita, the whole reason I give you this detailed travelogue, was a community that knew that it needed God and knew that it needed one another. It knew on the deepest of levels, and was grateful for the promises fulfilled in their sight, just as Zechariah was grateful for the promise he saw fulfilled in his sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To know that one is not self-sufficient is orthogonal enough to the dominant culture, as they say. It challenges the narratives about how we get over in the United States and what we owe to one another. Yet there is another challenge in proclaiming Christ as King as well, another deep and subversive truth in the proclamation. The powers-that-be in Washington D.C. and New York and London and so on around the globe may have disastrous effects on all of us. You know what they say about certain brown substances flowing downhill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a place like La Placita reveals that it is among the poor that ultimate reality, the truest true, can be found. Christ is King over the rich and for the poor. All the rest of it, all the gold leaf and marble, all the fake Versailles and trappings of power, that’s all nonsense. It’s not real. Christ the King and God his Father are in ultimate control of the destiny of the world, and they will rule in favor the little ones, not the classiest, the best, the greatest. Remember that. Trust it. When the kingdom comes, there’s going to be a taco truck on every corner. The poor kids are going to eat first, and people like me are going to do the buying. That's what it means to proclaim Christ as King. I'm down on that, to tell you the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mother Mary, Pray For Us</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sharing a prayer I wrote last night, thinking in particular about a Hispanic community ministered to by a Jesuit friend. Much of the language is drawn from Virgil Elizondo’s excellent book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com%2FGuadalupe-Creation-Virgilio-P-Elizondo%2Fdp%2F1570751102&quot;&gt;Guadalupe: Mother of the New Creation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever-Virgin, Holy Mary,&lt;br/&gt;
Queen of Mexico and Empress of the Americas,&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;who desires only to be our mother:&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;listen to the crying of your children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our nation has brought trouble upon itself.&lt;br/&gt;
We have made our way forward dark.&lt;br/&gt;
The powerful among us have led us almost to despair&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and laid heavy loads on the backs of the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made our society blind &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;to the dignity and worth of all people.&lt;br/&gt;
We have allowed ourselves to be dehumanized&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and to dehumanize others,&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;individually and as groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother Mary, pray for us&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;that we may be simple, faithful people seeking God,&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;filled with the life-giving power of the Holy Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May our hearts be broken and susceptible to change,&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and through us may a new and more authentic humanity&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;blossom to give life to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La Morenita, dark like us,&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You know that the greatest gifts often come&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;from those who the world thinks have nothing to offer.&lt;br/&gt;
Lead us away from despair into the way of conversion&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;that our hearts might reject all inferiority, worthlessness and &lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;helplessness, in ourselves and in others.&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Teach us your tender compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever-Virgin, Holy Mary,&lt;br/&gt;
Queen of Mexico and Empress of the Americas,&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;who desires only to be our mother:&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;listen to the crying of your children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hear our fear and our anger,&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and release us from their control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ask these things as your children through your Son Jesus Christ, and especially on behalf of our own children. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We Cannot Save Ourselves From Ourselves</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It never fails. Every election year, and particularly in presidential years, my colleagues come out with newsletter columns and sermons exhorting their flocks to somehow transcend the political season. Sometimes it comes in the form of encouragement to practice “God’s politics,” on the left by a concern for the poor or the earth, on the right by thinking of the Supreme Court or the traditional family. (We could of course add any number of causes to this list, across the political spectrum.) Occasionally, it will be something daffy, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://thefederalist.com/2016/10/31/denying-infant-baptism-leads-leftist-politics/&quot;&gt;a plea to embrace infant baptism so as to repel leftist politics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More often, though, it shows up in efforts to decry rancor, division, hateful speech, as though the entire stinking shitpile that is partisan politics could be cleansed, used a balm to heal the nations wounds and establish peace across the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how much we struggle and strive, there is no way to get out of the muck of partisan politics alive. &lt;!--more--&gt;There is no “higher politics” because there is no higher way of being human. We have to make our own choices and be responsible for them, not looking to God to bail us out by making our decisions for us. Taking the politics out of politics is a tempting ideal, but it’s scripturally and theologically inadequate. It misunderstands human nature, and ultimately, it proves ineffective because it’s trying to solve the wrong problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Christ and Campaigns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scripture is irreducibly political, which most people understand. What’s harder to grasp, harder not to read out of the testimony, is how &lt;em&gt;partisan&lt;/em&gt; it is. The story of the Exodus — the foundational story of the entire Bible — is about God taking sides with one side in an economic dispute. That bit about the golden calf? It’s a rebellion not just against God, but by one faction of the Israelite nation against Moses’ leadership in favor of Aaron and Miriam. In the post-Exodus history, there’s war, genocide, constant infighting among the Israelites and wheeling and dealing with the nations around them. The prophets can be caustic in their assessment of the political failures of Israel’s kings. This goes well beyond Amos’ call to let justice roll down like mighty waters. First Isaiah rails against the policy decision of his government to enter into an ill-advised alliance against Assyria, a fiasco which predictably leads to the disaster of Babylonian exile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, much of Jesus’ public ministry can be read as non-violent direct action against the Roman occupation and the corrupt leaders of his own people. One of the best ways to understand the Palm Sunday procession, for example, is as a bit of street theater lampooning the pretensions of Herod’s kingship and Roman military might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, though: Jesus didn’t know squat about elections. There was no voting in his day beyond what the villagers might decide to do in the local councils. Christ’s instructions about loving other members of the community are limited to the small social world his followers knew. That is, they were directions about interpersonal relationships, not political ties on a broader social level. They don’t map easily into anything resembling an election in a nation of 300 million people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus does talk about Pharisees, Sadducees, Levites — in other words, political factions of his day. But his words are of limited use: they boil down to “Anybody who is not against us is for us,” and “Everybody should practice just relationships.” Again, it’s hard to map that onto a modern presidential campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Partial Partisanship&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why: Christians, like all Americans, make two fundamental errors when we think about politics. Our first mistake is to think that changing interpersonal relationships can somehow drain the swamp of partisanship. But personal choices don’t actually drive the poisonous rhetoric we’ve seen building in American politics over the decades. As Reinhold Niebuhr points out in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Man-Immoral-Society-Theological/dp/0664235395&quot;&gt;Moral Man and Immoral Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, it’s easy to do right by someone on a personal level. You know the people you’re involved with, and the stakes are relatively low if you give them a break. To put the same point another way, you have to go through a whole process of dehumanization and depersonalization to assault someone, even verbally. So the ugliness we see at Trump rallies or from his more unsavory followers is rarely directed at people they know. It’s those who can be safely “othered” that catch the most flak: journalists, protesters, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wdam.com/story/33592564/church-in-greenville-burned-and-spray-painted-vote-trump&quot;&gt;black churches&lt;/a&gt;. (If you think liberals are exempt from &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.jsonline.com/blogs/news/117738098.html&quot;&gt;this sort of behavior&lt;/a&gt;, you’re sadly mistaken.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niebuhr’s point was that the broader the constituency we claim to represent, the harder it is to do the right thing. You have to choose sides. There are too many people who could be let down, the costs of going against the collective self-interest run too high. So we become trapped — or willing participants — in behavior we would otherwise know to be wrong. Partisan division is a social problem, not an individual one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse (this is the second basic mistake, and another caught by Niebuhr), we often &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; know our behavior is wrong. What we know is largely conditioned by &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; we know, which means we’re really good at seeing how “those people” are doing it wrong, but much less skilled at understanding how limited our perspective, or the perspective of our in-group, might be mistaken. The result is that you can normalize pretty much any behavior you like, as long as you convince people their friends and neighbors approve of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is precisely what we see in American politics today. People pick a team — black or white, Republican or Democrat — and it colors all their other political choices, from top to bottom. Astonishingly, voters will decide who to vote for in local elections based on their chosen presidential candidate. And woe betide anyone who is seen as challenging Team Red or Team Blue. They’ll be subjected to anti-Semitic remarks, rape and death threats, and worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But add to this moral myopia the political self-sorting going on in American society, and I have to wonder: who do my colleagues think they’re talking to in their newsletters, anyway? The parishioners of any one congregation are likely to be overwhelmingly of the same political party or views, left or right, and they’re just as likely to live in communities that are equally homogeneous. While the people in the pews may have experienced an unpleasant conversation or two, they’re unlikely to be able to change much, for the simple reason that they may not know many people who are all that different from them. The problem is precisely that Americans don’t talk to many people with deeply opposing political views. Liberals live in liberal cities, conservatives live in the country, and generally speaking, everyone selects their church community from people who look, talk, and vote the same way they do. Pastors who argue for civility are likely preaching to a choir of like-minded individuals, then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t disagree that Christians need to be careful in the language they use in the midst of an election. Nor do I disagree that they (or anyone) should vote their values. They should, with prayer and discernment. I even believe that Christians, surprisingly, can help change the tone and execution of politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to effect real changes requires addressing real causes, and the real cause of the freakshow that is American politics is not individual Christians being mean to one another. Rather, it’s a tribalism funded by racism, sexism, and the class warfare in whose cause they’re used. We wouldn’t be where we are today without the backlash to Civil Rights from 1964 on, nor without the Anita Bryant-led reaction to newfound freedoms for women, gays, and lesbians. And of course we couldn’t get here without the laissez-faire market doctrine that got rammed through on the back of the social divisions prompted and deepened by those outbursts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the tenor of politics will require a confrontation with those -isms: racism, sexism, classism. And yes, this also calls for a confrontation with the Christian seal of approval that has been laid on the various forms of supremacism we see in our society. Every religion in human history of any consequence has sooner or later been used to guarantee the legitimacy of government and the political norms of the ruling class. Christianity is no exception. That does not invalidate the faith, but it does require the practitioners of the religion to act in humility and penitence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own denomination has done a pretty good job of starting conversations on &lt;a href=&quot;http://privilege.uccpages.org/&quot;&gt;white privilege and sexuality&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, success is attenuated by self-selection: the churches most likely to be open to this work are exactly the ones least likely to need it. And efforts like this take time. There’s simply no substitute for building more just relationships person by person, brick by brick, church by church. In the meantime, hate and fear race around in the world in milliseconds, borne on the wings of free media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Americans find themselves in a dangerous and ambiguous place. For the second time in eight years, we seem to be on the cusp of historic change. Yet at the same time, the pushback to that change gets stiffer, more violent, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/11/03/republicans-are-now-vowing-total-war-and-the-consequences-could-be-immense/&quot;&gt;more corrosive of democratic norms&lt;/a&gt;. While political leadership in the US will change, and the conditions that keep women and minorities down will ameliorate, those conditions will be with us for a long time to come, as will the tribalism they sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot save ourselves from ourselves, Christians, Americans, or otherwise. That is what it means to be born into original sin, if you’ll allow me the conceit. The conditions that created our deep, abiding and vicious partisanship are the marrow of American life. We can’t change those conditions without changing ourselves, and that is going to take a very long time at the least. But by the grace of God or perhaps by dint of common human decency, we can at least kick against the prevailing conditions while we await and perhaps pray for a better life to come. That begins with the right response to the right problem. Partisan rancor is only the symptom. The real problem is the character flaws that cause the divisions. Those worry me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Church Belongs To The The Grandmas, The Rest Of Us Just Play In It</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=342452519&quot;&gt;Luke 17:5-10 &amp;amp; 2 Timothy 1:3-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to talk this morning about a subject that has been on my mind—on the mind of every decent pastor—for the past few years, which is how to keep the next generation in the church. It is, as you know, far from guaranteed that our children and grandchildren will grow up to become sustaining members of the community that helped to raise them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many possible reasons for this change. The favorite suspect is usually Sunday morning sports, but as I like to point out, that really only came about after many people decided their sabbath days were free for activities other than worship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I'm thinking about this subject is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prri.org/research/prri-rns-2016-religiously-unaffiliated-americans/&quot;&gt;a survey that came out this week&lt;/a&gt; that took the radical step of asking people why they left Christianity behind. The survey's authors begin by pointing out that many of the people we call millennials were children of divorced parents in the 1980's and 90's. When parents split, it becomes more difficult to maintain a consistent religious practice, with the result that many families simply stop going to church altogether. That may be why we're seeing religious disaffiliation exploding these days. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you ask people about why they left, they come up with some surprising answers. Surprisingly few say their church became too focused on politics. Some say the clergy sex-abuse scandal pushed them out. That's mostly in the Catholic church, of course, but it affects Protestants too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 30% of the religiously unaffiliated say they left the faith because of negative remarks about gays and lesbians. Now, whatever you think about homosexuality, it's simply a given for people under the age of 30. They don't understand why people would judge or shame their gay friends, and they're not willing to hang around with people who do. As it happens, that's again a very large problem in the Catholic church, but it does affect Protestants to a lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's where it really gets interesting: the biggest single reason people cite for no longer being Christian is that they stopped believing in the religion's teachings. 60% of unaffiliated people say that. We'd have to do some more research into the question, but I assume that this category would include young people for whom Christianity never really made sense in the first place, and who at some point simply decided to quit trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Either way, the conclusion is obvious: Christians, on the whole, have failed to pass on the faith to younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many possible explanations for this. I won't bore you with all of them. My own theory is that our society has changed so quickly over the past 50 years that the church has simply not been able to keep up. Somehow or another, we have lost the bead on how to convey and instill a that mustard seed faith for many children and young adults. The categories of faith don't make sense to them because in many ways, they don't make sense to us, and so we're not able to teach them. As I said a Sunday or two ago, we seem to do a good job of teaching kids right from wrong, but not such a good job of showing them how the living God is present and at work among us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no one really to blame for this. It's just something that happened, and now we have to figure out how to deal with it. There are also many theories for how to do that. I won't bore you with them, either. I suspect that the social change we've seen is so large that nobody really has a handle on it yet. We're all just taking shots in the dark. The picture will probably (hopefully) become clearer over the next few decades. The church will adjust, and go on, most likely in a much smaller form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also suspect that there may be no one right answer. There are lots of suggestions, but in the end, it may be that Christians have to find what works with these young people in this particular place and this particular time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say that in part because I have become convinced that what young people are looking for in faith is not ideas or beliefs but relationships, and of course everyone's relationship is different. Young people want companions, not bosses. They want older people to be present with them in an authentic and egalitarian way on their journey. And to the extent that they know God, their knowledge comes through relationships, through real, meaningful community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is with us, we say. How can we show that in a way that's more than lip service? Churches—including our own—will have to become laboratories in search of the answer to that question if they want to survive. We will have to increase our own faith, and find a way to show it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How? That's what we, the people of St. Paul's, have to figure out. I can't tell you exactly, because again, it's relational. We'll have to work it out together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can at least point us to the beginnings. We know from Luke that the way forward will have to involve embracing all people, even and particularly those our society despises. In fact, we will have to search those people out. Community is not enough if it's limited only to us. We will have to expand our community, and meet with the larger community outside it. The section of Luke's gospel we've been reading over the past few weeks is all about finding those who have been lost and welcoming as equals at table those who would otherwise be rejected by our society. And as this morning's lesson tells us, we have to do that as a matter of course. No complaining, no whining, no dragging our feet, no seeking special recognition when we do it. If we want to increase our faith, we have to forge new relationships, because that's what Jesus tells us to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also must look to old relationships. In his letter to Timothy, Paul speaks of &quot;a faith that lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice.&quot; It's mothers and grandmothers, fathers and grandfathers, who for the most part keep the faith going from generation to generation. Not because there's anything wrong with single people, or the childless, but because our parents and grandparents have an irreplaceable role in transmitting love across the generations. You want to know how to show young people the presence of the living God? Love them, unconditionally, like a grandmother loves her grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love is the gift of God that is to be rekindled in each of us, loving presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;for God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but rather a spirit of power and of love and of self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we are brave enough to claim the power given to us by God to be present to one another as God is present to us, &quot;with the power of the Holy Spirit living in us,&quot; all things are possible. The trick, as Paul tells us, is to be self-disciplined enough to make it happen. It involves some sacrifice and perhaps some things we'd rather not do. But then, whoever said life together was going to be easy? Relationships are hard work, but they're usually worth it in the end. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Author does *not* say &quot;let us swim the 800m relay that is before us&quot;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=338219584&quot;&gt;Hebrews 11:29-12:2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the Olympics, and as I write track and field competitions are on television, at least to the extent that any part of the Olympics could be said to be on NBC. In any case, they're supposed to have center stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps it's appropriate that we talk about running metaphors this morning. (Don't ask me about actual track and field, though. I don't know a thing about it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read a pastor the other say that he got a lot happier with his career when he figured out that ministry is not a solo shot like the 400 meters or even a marathon. As he says, ministry is more like a relay race: you take the baton from the guy before you, do what you can, then pass it off to the guy after you. It's the team that wins, not the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like that metaphor. I like it a lot. You try not to fumble the hand-off in either direction, and in the middle, you do the best you can. If you think about it, it applies not just to pastors and their ministries, but to the life of the church in general. St. Paul's has been here for 170 years. In many ways, we're just trying to keep going what we've been handed, and to hand it off to those who come after us.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anonymous author of the letter to the Hebrews (we don't have a name) has the same idea. He talks about all those who have been stages in the relay before us: there were the Israelites who followed Moses out of Egypt, and the armies who blew the horns to drop the walls of Jericho. Oddly, there's Rahab the prostitute who helped bring down Jericho, even though she herself was not an Israelite. And then, because time is getting short, the author just starts rattling off names and brief summaries of stories his listeners surely understand. We need only mention a few: it's of course Daniel who shuts the mouths of lions. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego quench the raging fire of the furnace into which they're cast. We don't often think about resurrection before Christ on Easter morning, but the prophets Elijah and Elishah are said to have raised sons from the dead and returned them to their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These, as I say, are all the people who have come before us in the race, examples of faith and perseverance. Some, the author reminds us, won't be joining us on the medals stand. Some were tortured (that is, stretched on the rack). Some were mocked and flogged, some thrown in jail, others were stoned to death, sawn in two, executed at swordpoint, some were impoverished or otherwise oppressed—the author implies that he could go on with this list for a while if he wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the point. It might seem difficult to us now, but it hasn't exactly been easy in the past, either. In fact, those who came before us had it much worse. Though their faith was strong, they didn't get a medal at all, because it's only after Christ that humanity becomes eligible for the big prizes. All that sacrifice, and they've just been setting the stage for us to shine—to be perfected. Judges give us a 10 out of 10&lt;img src=&quot;A&quot; alt=&quot;^n&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we should look to the example of those who have come before us as we try to gird ourselves for the struggles of today. If they can suffer worse for less reward, we can keep going. &quot;Let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us,&quot; as the author has it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we run, we have a cheering section. &quot;Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses&quot; is actually an image of people in a stadium watching athletes at work. The people who have run the race before us are now our greatest fans. And we have another example as well: &quot;Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.&quot; He just had a great lap, says the author, watch him and see how it's done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let's not get ahead of ourselves. If we're going to run this here race, we need to get rid of the things that slow us down: the weight, or encumbrances, and the sin that is so happy to hang on to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife, who is perhaps happiest in her life when she's organizing something, sometimes talks about &quot;cumber,&quot; which is all that clutter and c-r-a-p that builds up when you're not paying attention. She says messes cause anxiety, and we all know that having too much stuff can be a burden. As Jesus teaches, it keeps us away from who we should be and what we should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that is real, but perhaps a sermon for another time. The sin interests me more this morning. Again, I am not talking about sin in the sense we usually do, in terms of sex or divorce, using drugs or failing to &quot;give God glory&quot; in our entire lives. For the author of Hebrews, sin is as much falling away from faith in Jesus as anything. For me, it's something entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been reading in recent weeks about what happened when Christianity first encountered native American ways of understanding the world during the Spanish conquest of Mexico. (Yes, I am a nerd.) The short version is that the Christians attempted to destroy everything that wasn't Spanish, to tell the native Mexicans that they were bad and full of sin. Many of those natives internalized that message and came to believe that they must hate themselves in order to become Christians. The theologian Virgil Elizondo says against this,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversion to the way of Jesus is beautiful. It is not a call to self-destruction…Conversion certainly means a dying to sin, but it does not mean a total destruction of one's way of life. In fact, the worst sin of all is the failure to recognize our own inner and outer dignity, beauty, and inner worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should really have that made up as a sign and put it up in the church. This is what it means to lay aside every weight and sin: to leave behind all those ways we have to damage our dignity, beauty, and inner worth. Those things that cause such damage are the sins worth talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set them aside in order to live like Jesus, in the beautiful way of Jesus, &quot;for the sake of the joy&quot; that is set before us, disregarding the ways of death and shame. Elizondo says true faith comes to us in &quot;flowers and song,&quot; in the joy-filled opening of ourselves to God. We could work stand to work on the song part, to be honest. Maybe we should import some of the Mexican worship bands I've seen, with trumpets, guitars, and tubas. I'll leave it to you to decide the state of our flowers. Where I see the joy most clearly in our life together is the happy chatter before and after worship. You are happiest, most joyful, in relationship with one another. I suspect that more than a few of you have felt your &quot;inner and outer dignity, beauty, and inner worth&quot; restored in those conversations. You feel embraced in this community, accepted for who you are without judgment. We should do more along those lines—it's a way to continue to run the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see joy set before us in our children as well, when they come to talk to me, when they go downstairs to learn and play, when they sing before us. I wasn't present for the entire Camp Winnebeckman,&lt;a href=&quot;A&quot;&gt;^n&lt;/a&gt; but enough to know that the kids did find joy there, enough to be deeply grateful for the work Kim and Noel and Nancy put into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all this, I want to say that as much as anything, the work of the church, the baton we have been handed in the relay, is to instill in those children a sense of their &quot;inner and outer dignity, beauty, and worth.&quot; The work we have been given, the race that we run, is to teach our children of God's love for them, and the need to demonstrate that love to others who need to hear of it. We go about that work with the full weight of our ancestors behind us, cheering us on. We go about it with the example of Jesus before us, demonstrating the love that is possible and the end toward which we race. Amen.&lt;/p&gt;
