        </h2>
            <p>Nancy LeTourneau delved into the mystery of the “<a href="http://washingtonmonthly.com/2016/12/28/how-do-we-bridge-the-reality-gap/#.WGQrukbIUD0.twitter">reality gap</a>” over at the Washington Monthly blog earlier today. If you’re not familiar with that (the reality gap, not Washington Monthly), it’s the phenomenon of large segments of the population believing things that are demonstrably untrue, for example that unemployment has risen under Obama (it has not), or that more people are without health insurance (they are not). They call this a “gap” because—there is no gentle way to put this—it’s almost always Republicans who get the facts wrong.</p>

        </h2>
            <p>In just less than a month, a man with a series of negative qualities almost too long to list will take over the White House from the first black president. He is a racist, he is a xenophobe, a bigot, a misogynist. He is a reckless businessman who has run bankrupt multiple times, cheated everyone he could, and perjured himself again and again in lawsuits. He is by his own admission a serial abuser of women and a general creep. There is much more beside this. None of this is an insult, by the way, only fair and demonstrable characterization.</p>

            <p>Sharing a prayer I wrote last night, thinking in particular about a Hispanic community ministered to by a Jesuit friend. Much of the language is drawn from Virgil Elizondo’s excellent book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com%2FGuadalupe-Creation-Virgilio-P-Elizondo%2Fdp%2F1570751102">Guadalupe: Mother of the New Creation</a></em>.</p>

            <p>It never fails. Every election year, and particularly in presidential years, my colleagues come out with newsletter columns and sermons exhorting their flocks to somehow transcend the political season. Sometimes it comes in the form of encouragement to practice “God’s politics,” on the left by a concern for the poor or the earth, on the right by thinking of the Supreme Court or the traditional family. (We could of course add any number of causes to this list, across the political spectrum.)

<p>I don’t think I’ve mentioned this before here, but when it comes to reading about leadership, I’m a big fan of the author <a href="http://www.peterblock.com/">Peter Block</a>. He has some ideas that I find very helpful, such as leadership through asking good questions, rather than supplying answers, leadership as drawing people together and facilitating their discussions, stepping out of the way and letting people make their own decisions. If you’ve ever been in a meeting with me and I say something that makes you think “That’s different,” chances are that I’m either getting it from Peter Block or being a flake. You choose.</p>

He died the day after his 90th birhday, an hour and a half after I visited and offered prayer for him. When I say “go in peace,” it’s not an order!</em></p>

        </h2>
            <div><span>*This is a rough draft of the liturgy I hope to use for a Protestant service in the St. Agnes chapel at Marian University on Ash Wednesday. We’ll see.*</span></div>
<div><span>*  
*</span></div>
<div><span>**Greeting**</span></div>
<div><span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, + the steadfast love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. **And also with you.**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>Hymn</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>**Introduction**</span></div>
<div><span>On Ash Wednesday, Christians gather to confess their sins, resolve to do better, and to hear God’s reassurance. We draw near to God in word and worship to learn what we must do to be rebuilt as the people of God, and to hear once again God’s promise of new life.</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>God gives us the rituals of this holy day not to burden us with laws we cannot keep, but to remove from us our grief, renew the branches of Christ Jesus, and to cause us to hear and see one another, so that we may restore the vital imagination of our faith put into action.</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>**Gospel Reading**: Matthew 6:1-6, 16-21</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>“Beware of practicing your piety before others in order to be seen by them; for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven.</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>“So whenever you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</span></div>
<div><span>so that your alms may be done in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>“And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, so that they may be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>But whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>“And whenever you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so as to show others that they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward.</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>so that your fasting may be seen not by others but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal;</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal.</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. </span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>**Remarks**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>**Prayer of Confession**</span></div>
<div><span>[The prophet Isaiah](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=227017187) records the people of his time wondering why God no longer seemed to hear them when they prayed in the temple. The answer came swiftly:</span></div>
<div><span>“You serve your own needs,” said God, “when you gather for worship.”</span></div>
<div><span>Then you leave and you oppress the people who work for you.”</span></div>
<div><span>May the Lord have mercy on us if we do anything like this.</span></div>
<div><span>**Lord have mercy on us.**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>God continued: “You fast and pray to make yourselves better people, but then you quarrel and fight and even resort to violence!”</span></div>
<div><span>May Christ have mercy on us if we do anything like this.</span></div>
<div><span>**Christ have mercy on us.**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>God had one more thing to say. “You worship only to make yourself known to me, to get me to notice how good you are, but I will not hear false prayers.”</span></div>
<div><span>May the Lord have mercy on us if we do anything like this.</span></div>
<div><span>**Lord have mercy on us.**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>By the grace of God, the Lord is merciful and gracious,</span></div>
<div><span>   slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. </span></div>
<div><span>As a father has compassion for his children,</span></div>
<div><span>   so the Lord has compassion for those who fear him. </span></div>
<div><span>For God knows how we were made;</span></div>
<div><span>   and remembers that we are dust. ([Psalm 103:8, 14](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=227017293))</span></div>
<div><span>Our sins are forgiven us.</span></div>
<div><span>Let us be renewed. **Amen.**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>**Prayers of Intercession**</span></div>
<div><span>Let us pray now for our needs, and the needs of others.</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>When we keep alive injustice and lay unfair burdens on other people, make us aware of what we are doing, and free us to free others and change the world where we can. Lord in your mercy, **hear our prayer.**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>When we are afraid that we will not have enough money for our lives, widen our hearts to share our bread with the hungry. Lord in your mercy, **hear our prayer.**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>When we are afraid that we will have no place to live or no space at our table, grant us the grace of generosity that we might shelter the homeless and welcome them into our lives. Lord in your mercy, **hear our prayer.**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>When we are saddened and depressed by the figures we see in the mirror, cause us to remember those who shiver without a winter coat, the poor of the world who stand in tatters, and to treat them as if they were our very own brothers and sisters. Lord in your mercy, **hear our prayer.**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>When we are tempted to judge one another, when we are tempted to say mean or thoughtless things of others, turn our minds instead to lifting their burdens.</span></div>
<div><span>Lord in your mercy, **hear our prayer.**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>

<div><span>Lord, hear our prayer, for we pray to you as Christ our Savior taught us, saying,</span></div>
<div><span>**Our Father in heaven,**</span></div>
<div><span>**<span></span>hallowed be your name,**</span></div>
<div><span>**<span></span>your kingdom come,**</span></div>

<div><span>Hymn</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>**Release of sins and shortcomings and imposition of ashes**</span></div>
<div><span>Dear friends in Christ, I invite you to come forward, when you are ready, and deposit those sins, shortcomings, and failures that have been bothering you in the wastebasket, where they belong. When you have released your burden, you may come a little closer and receive the sign of ashes to signal your penitence and your determination to be remade in Lent. When we have all received the sign, we have a short prayer, and then conclude this afternoon’s service. Come, as you are ready.</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>*When all are done:*</span></div>
<div><span>Gracious God, make us into the people we ought to be. In this Lenten season, heal our hearts and make us steadfast and true. Through true fasting, teach us to be fair to one another and to live together the right way. In our prayers, help us not to seek for ourselves, but to see one another and imagine what must be done. In acts of generosity, allow us to rebuild our community, your kingdom. Grant us above all else humility, and bring us home from the loneliness of exile to stand together with you and all our brothers and sisters, as one reconciled people. **Amen.**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>Song</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>**Blessing and Sending**</span></div>
<div><span>The Lord bless you and keep you.</span></div>
<div><span>The Lord’s face shine on you with grace and mercy.</span></div>
<div><span>The Lord look upon you with favor and + give you peace.</span></div>
<div><span>**Amen.**</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>You are marked with the Sign + of the Cross of Christ. </span></div>
<div><span>Go forth in penitence and a sincere desire to do what is right, and the peace of God be with you unto life eternal. **Amen. Thanks be to God.**</span></div>

            <div><span>*The following blessing was inspired by a Catholic children’s liturgy for blessing a nativity set before Christmas, the idea of which I have obviously adapted to the current situation.

<div><span>God our Father, who longs to gather us</span></div>
<div><span>     as a hen shelters her brood beneath her wings:</span></div>
<div><span>You have heard the voice of Rachel</span></div>

<div><span>You have heard the cries and lamentations</span></div>
<div><span><span></span>     of the parents of Bethlehem</span></div>
<div><span><span></span>     when their sons were sacrificed for Herod’s power.</span></div>
<div><span>You shared with Mary in the loss</span></div>
<div><span><span></span>     of a Son taken away far too young,</span></div>
<div><span><span></span>     and you know the sword-pierced heart of every grieving parent.</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>Lord our God, you have promised to wipe away every tear from our eyes</span></div>
<div><span><span></span>     when your Son, our Lord, takes the heavenly throne</span></div>

            <p>Today is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaudete_Sunday"><em>Gaudete Sunday,</em></a> the day when Christians rejoice, remembering that Christ will come again at the end of time. It may seem like a sick joke to proclaim such a day this soon after the events at Sandy Hook. It will particularly seem that way to our secular friends whose views of faith have been soured by exposure to conservative God representatives eager to lay blame for the most recent tragedy, whatever it might be.</p>

            <p>It might have been Henry David Thoreau, or it might have been E.B. White—I no longer remember, and most of my books are now packed away under a friend’s basement stairs—but someone once wrote that a man who was too busy to look up in the fall and watch a line of geese pass was too busy to live. I’ve always agreed, and at least tried to live by the advice.</p>

            <p>Consider this some very preliminary notes on a much longer piece. I have written a lot about the work of Walter Brueggemann over the past few years, in blogs and a book and articles, including an interview with the man himself. After all that, I’m still finding new ways to apply his insights, including with college freshmen. An assignment for my course on “Christianity and Contemporary Culture” occasions this essay: I wanted to put down some thoughts so my students could see where I was going with the paper they’re being asked to write.<br />

        </h2>
            <p>Back in February, a team of laypeople and I attended a meeting aimed at helping (mostly) congregations in the Wisconsin Conference of the United Church of Christ renew themselves. The keynote speaker was as unassuming older gentleman, a member of the Church of the Brethren, who had an easy laugh and a very warm way of highlighting the issues in renewal. He had spoken on the subject many times, including in Wisconsin. In fact, I found out later that he had written more than thirty books on the subject of congregations. We came away feeling like we had gotten good advice.</p>

            <p>Fearful as it is, I can empathize deeply with the parents of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/magazine/can-you-call-a-9-year-old-a-psychopath.html?pagewanted=all">a nine-year-old budding psychopath</a>. Children with severe RAD aren’t necessarily malicious in the same way as sociopaths are. But they are manipulative and calculating, and there’s often a question of how genuine their behavior is at any given moment. In our case, we’ve given up trying to find our child’s authentic self; there doesn’t seem to be one, because the personality has not come together in any real sense. So there are different aspects of the self that are presented to meet her needs at different points, but we’re under no illusions that those aspects are stable or given without an eye to what can be gained from the situation. Usually, the game is to be the center of attention and/or receive nurture while minimizing responsibility. It looks normal, even charming, on a superficial level. But when you start to spend time with the kid, you start to realize that not all is well.</p>

            <p>Pretty straightforward, I think. Based mostly on <a href="http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=202903678">Psalm 22:25-31, with nods to 1 John 4:7-21 and John 15:1-8</a>. Somehow or another, it worked out neatly (more or less) to write the <a href="http://fivepractices.org/">Five Practices of Fruitful Congregations</a> into the petitions. Our congregation is currently going through that renewal process, so it’s nice to work them in when I can.</p>

        </h2>
            <p>I’ve been using the United Church of Christ short communion service forever and a day, almost without interruption through my twelve years in ministry. But I never really warmed to it. Like most things in the UCC, it seems a bit tilted toward social justice, and it goes to some lengths to avoid referring to Jesus as a “he.” Nothing wrong with that, except when you’re using it with elderly homebound members who neither know nor care about inclusive language. Likewise, it’s a bit long in places, and assumes that the recipients of the communion are knowledgeable enough about liturgy to join in in several places. That’s not a safe assumption with older Protestants who often didn’t grow up with a very participatory style of worship, shall we say. Even when they did, there are often barriers to participation, whether cognitive or physical.</p>

            <p>Just finished writing a very challenging sermon for Palm Sunday, in which I ask the church to acknowledge the ways in which we fail our young people by using up our time and energy on petty drama instead putting their faith formation at the top of our agenda. In our case, it’s stupid crap like the arrangement of the pews or money given away to mission years ago. Other churches have similar fights. I know more than one congregation that’s had battles royale over whether to update the carpet in the sanctuary. Everybody’s got a story.</p>

            <p>Bad news is breaking out all over the place in this neck of the woods. The school district has to close a $900,000 deficit, caused in roughly equal parts by decreased property taxes revenues, the end of a federal grant, and an ill-timed boost to the technology budget. All of this will be paid for by staff cuts, outsourcing, consolidation, and whatever other forms of belt-tightening can be jerry-rigged to demonstrate Fiscal Conservatism. And all of it will bring out the yahoo element at the initial public hearing, which I expect to be full to the brim with weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth about how dreadfully expensive public education is, and how taxpayers simply cannot afford to give a single penny more to those Cadillac-driving union-minioning teacher monsters!</p>

            <p>It’s been easily twenty years since I last spoke to <a href="http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/education/university/memorial-service-set-for-uw-history-professor-noted-expert-boyer/article_ccc425ca-784b-11e1-8fbf-0019bb2963f4.html">Paul Boyer</a>. Oddly enough, I just thought of him the other day when I saw a picture of the old Observatory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus. He had a beautiful office there, where I went to see him once or twice. When I heard this morning that he had died of cancer at 76, I was saddened, despite how long it’s been.</p>

            <p>There’s a large Assembly of God congregation near us that’s pretty obviously working some kind of publicity campaign.

            <p>Bill had a pretty good day yesterday. He got to play outside after school, and just before dinner, we got a phone call inviting him to a sleepover tomorrow night. After dinner he and I filled up the tires on my bike, dusted it off, and took a ride down to Town Hall and back. (I wanted to ask a question of the board before their meeting that night.) As we parked our bikes, we spotted a black cat walking in the grass on a hillside behind the hall. When we came out, a second one had appeared closer to the door. He had obviously been through the wringer somehow: he had scabbed-over wounds on his rump, and one tooth stuck out from his mouth at a crazy angle, almost perpendicular to his jaw.</p>

They just spit in your eye, then stab you in the face.”</p>

By the way, the Bible says nothing about what “our” position on Israel should be.

            <p>A colleague once accused me of being “kyriarchical,” of using too much “church language” in my worship services. I had to wonder if she was listening to herself. What else would you use in a church service but the language of the church? It’s a bit like being accused of being Euro-Centric while teaching Hungarian. Why yes, I suppose I am.</p>

        </h2>
            <div><span>According to second or third or fourth-hand gossip, “Everybody in the Town of Wayne hates Pastor Dan,” apparently because three or four years ago I had the nerve to go to a liquor license renewal hearing to point out that the bar in question was not a good neighbor. Since then I have complained exactly once to the town chairman when the bar flouted the restrictions placed on them.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>This is enough to make me a pariah in the smelt-eating circuit, at least if some people are to be believed.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>As you might imagine, I am not overly concerned by any of this. First of all, I know it’s not true, not even close. Second, I don’t need the esteem of any of the people in question. It is a bit odd to think that I might have a reputation as a monster in certain segments of my neighborhood. Among other awfulness, I caused some pews to be turned sideways in the sanctuary so that they form a “U” shape rather than strict ranks. I am a monster, I tell you. But I rarely interact with the people outside the congregation who would listen to such things, and let’s be honest, their opinion doesn’t count for very much. They are chronically and severely unhappy, and most of their complaints go in one ear and out the other.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>The only reason I bring this up at all—other than to have a larf about it—is the culture it reveals. There seems to be a subset of our township that is both reactionary and entrenched. They’re mostly what you might call “country people,” or “low-information voters” in another context. They’re not very well educated, and they tend to have low social mobility. They don’t move around very often, or travel outside their tight circle of family and friends, and they tend not to move very far up the social ladder. The two of those are connected: taking the kind of job that moves you very far up the scale tends to take you away from the area. There are a few exceptions to the rule, but not many. So if you want to live in this rural area close to your family, you might have to take a job in the local factory, or driving a truck, or working construction.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>I’ve seen this in other parts of the country, most notably Central Pennsylvania, where people are downright proud to die thirty feet from where they were born. But I’m told the same culture exists around the nation, in rural Maine and inland California, among other places.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>

<div><span>What is very curious to me is how the culture sponsors a certain frame of mind that borders on mental illness. Any pastor reading this will know what I mean when I talk about the “theology of scarcity” that pervades the church. It is the sense that there is never enough time or money or interpersonal resources to meet the challenges set before us. These folks feel like they start life in a hole that they can never quite climb out of, a hallmark of clinical anxiety. Some of them go farther, turning to a bit of paranoia to explain those forces out to hold them down. Black presidents and pastors who won’t put up with the “good enough” that they’ve learned to suffer with, among other things.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>It might make a good article to think about how this negativity might be correlated to the decline of social mobility in the United States. It’s probably not an accident that the “good old days” that people look back on are the 1950’s, when upward mobility was almost at its peak. These days, it’s as low as it has been since right after World War I. That might make people a bit grumpy.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>I’m curious to know what anyone else’s experiences with this culture might be. Have you seen it? Do you have any idea what causes it? Have you heard yet that everybody hates me? Because they do, they totally do.</span></div>

&gt; After just four days on YouTube, “Hooking Kids on Sex” exceeded 200,000 views. Then, an ex-intern of Planned Parenthood got the white-hot investigative report by American Life League on Planned Parenthood sex education blocked by YouTube. Now, ALL has responded with “Hooked on Sex II.” At four minutes in, the revised video reveals a 1969 Planned Parenthood internal document that proposes an official policy of “restructure the family,” “forced abortions,” “encourage increased homosexuality,” and “avoid marriage.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Even people who thought they knew better were shocked by how Planned Parenthood promotes sex to youngsters,” said Paul Rondeau, executive director at American Life League. “Activists alleged that because Joe Camel was a cartoon character, he must be banned to protect kids from smoking. Today, Planned Parenthood cartoons outright tell children to have sex and show them how. These cartoons for ten-year-olds are so sexually explicit that YouTube restricted our first video about them to adult viewing only.”</li>

        </h2>
            <div><span></span></div>
<div><span>**[Ephesians 2:13-20](http://bible.oremus.org/?ql=197548807)**</span></div>
<div><span>**  
**</span></div>
<div><span>Thank you once again for inviting me here to speak to you tonight. I am grateful for the opportunity in no small part because, unlike your pastor, I am a manuscript preacher. Therefore, I may seem to be a less “exciting” preacher, and yet you keep asking me back. So thank you for that.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>Now, *some* pastors dress up as stars and Christmas trees and whatnot. I don’t do that. I have to find my own ways of creating excitement. I mean to do that by provoking you a little later on. This, of course, is the price you pay for allowing any old disreputable pastor to step foot in your pulpit. I mean to make Eric pay for going to Atlanta without me.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>Before I can do that, however, I have to give you the boring stuff. In other words, I have to tell you what the heck is going on in this passage.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>To wit: Paul’s age, like our own, was by and large one of religious diversity and tolerance. Essentially, the way religion worked in those days was, “You scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours.” Or, better, “You recognize my gods and I’ll recognize yours.” The exception to this rule were the Jews, who didn’t go along to get along. They only recognized one God—the Lord God of scripture—and they only recognized one way of doing things, the Jewish law. Where this came out was in matters of the calendar and in matters of custom. In ancient times, they didn’t have weekends like we do. They had a series of religious festivals sprinkled throughout the year. So you might work five days, and then take a day or two off to celebrate and make sacrifices to Juno, then work another ten and do the same thing for Mars.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>The Jews wouldn’t do this. They said, you work six days, you take the seventh off. And unlike everybody else in town, we’re not going to the temple to make a sacrifice to Juno or Mars or the Caesar or whoever. There’s only one God, and they’re not it.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>Does this begin to sound like any presidential candidates you’ve heard of?</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>In any case, society in Paul’s day made some allowances for Jewish practice. You want to work a schedule like that? Fine. You don’t want to make sacrifices? Fine. Just pay your taxes on time. But there was a good bit of mutual animosity between pagans and Jews. The pagans thought the Jews were weird and stubborn, and the Jews thought the pagans were sinners.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>Into this mess steps the new Christian movement. Specifically, with Paul, the Christ-followers start to pick up members who were all-but Jews. God-fearers, they were called. These people were pagan converts who attended synagogue regularly and tried to live like Jews, but didn’t follow all the law. Hey look, if you’re an adult male who’s managed to avoid being circumcised, you might not be so interested in following the entire law either. They didn’t have anesthetic back then, you know.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>As Paul gathers the God-fearers into a new Christian community, he has to answer the question of where they fit into the scheme of things. How do they relate to the Jews? How do they relate the wider society? Who *are* we?</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>That’s the question he takes up in his letter to the Ephesian church, and he does it in his typically brash way. You started out, he tells the Ephesians, you started out alienated from the Jewish people, because you didn’t want to get circumcised. No, really: that’s what he says. But in Christ, you who were once far off have been brought near to the Jewish God. It’s worth noticing here that “far off” and “near” are technical terms used in Judaism at this time to describe gentiles and Jews. In other words, Christ has accomplished what Jewish legalism could not: it has made you people of the Lord. </span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span></span></div>
<div><span>Paul continues:</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p><span>For he is our peace; in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us.</span></p>

Obviously, this is an injustice and against the gospel. But as the family members point out, it is first of all a pastoral failure. What kind of a pastor doesn’t show at the graveside and doesn’t make arrangements for someone to cover for him? The diocese says it is “against policy” to deny someone communion under such circumstances. The problem for them—and for the Catholic church as a whole—is that the more they insert themselves into matters of “policy” in these cases, the more they own the inevitable lapses into cruelty. It’s little wonder the family is hearing about friends’ faith being shaken. They’re probably starting to get the idea that this wasn’t an exception but the system working as designed.</li>

        </h2>
            <div>Today, I am seriously considering a hot toddy in honor of St. Blaise (or St. Blase, St. Blazey, San Biago, San Blas, Agios Vlasios, or Sourb Barsegh), the patron saint of throat illnesses, wild animals and wool gatherers, among a great many other things. The only trouble is that I’m not sure rye would work with lemon and honey. Still, sacrifices must be made to advance knowledge.</div>
<div><span>Blaise was a wealthy Armenian physician in what was then Sebastea, Cappadocia and is now Silvas, Turkey. It is a place best known for sour yogurt soup, sour potato soup (with yogurt), and killing people. According to legend, 65 people drowned in a pond trying to kill Blase, plus seven women who were so impressed by his torture that they gathered up his blood and refused to sacrifice it to the Roman gods. Some people will do anything to get out of the house. The women reportedly shed milk rather than blood from their wounds, leading two of their children to exclaim, “leave us not after thee, but right sweet mother, like as thou hast nourished us with thy milk so replenish us with the realm of heaven.” Kids say the darndest things.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>A few years later, the townfolk tried to revive the old show in a barn, but they were only able to martyr 40 Christians. One wonders how hard they were trying. That’s nothing by Broadway standards. Then there were the usual wars and invasions by Tamerlane. About twenty years ago, rioters protesting a humorist’s presence at a conference burned a hotel in Sivas, killing 37 people. Anyone who sees this as evidence of barbarism hasn’t tried to read Larry the Cable Guy’s book. Lately, hardly anyone’s been massacred there, though.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>Blaise lived in a cave, like any self-respecting saint. He also had birds and animals who would come to see him, but they were polite enough to wait until after he was done with his prayers. At our house, they won’t even wait for dinner to be over.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>One day, a widow told Blaise a wolf was being mean to her little piggy. Well, what would you expect? He had hardly chewed on the pig at all, maybe just a little around the ears and tail as an appetizer. But Blaise asked the to give the little porker back to the widow, and he did. Later the widow slaughtered the pig and brought its head and feet to Blaise in prison. The pig’s reaction to his short-lived reprieve is not recorded, but I’ll bet the wolf was disappointed. The widow also brought Blaise a pair of candles, which became one of his symbols in later years. Oddly, no one seems to have paired them with a pig’s head.</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span>  
<span>Everybody agrees that Blaise ran into trouble in 316, unless it was 387 or 283. Anyway, it was when Agricola was governor of the region and during the fifteen minutes or so when Licinius Augustus controlled Cappadocia and didn’t like Christians. *He* came to a sticky end later in his second civil war against Constantine. Some people just don’t know how to be satisfied with occupying Thrace. Blaise was peacefully avoiding the soldiers in his cave when some hunters stumbled across him and turned him in to the governor. And what, we may ask, were they doing in the woods out of season? Blaise may or may not have been healing wild animals when he was captured. You didn’t hear that from a wolf.</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span>  
<span>While in custody, Blaise was beaten both with and without iron carding combs, which I have to admit is a new one on me. According to Wikipedia,</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p><span>The iron carding combs typically used for torture were sturdy instruments with one or two rows of teeth, each a few inches in length and designed to prepare wool and other fibres for worsted-spun thread. Used for rough fibres, these instruments resembled miniature garden rakes rather than the modern, short-toothed carders that are used to prepare wool for spinning and which resemble brushes for dog grooming.</span></p>
</blockquote>

It is the misrepresentation that the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) recognizes the ceremony and the resulting relationship to be a marriage in the eyes of the church,” read the majority opinion.“So the critical question is not whether the definitional language creates proscribed conduct, it is whether it is permissible to represent that one is doing something which one cannot constitutionally do.”</li>

  <li>It should be noted that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-17072211">this</a> is how things are done in the US.</li>
  <li>Actually, Newt, when he comes to legal matters, <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/gingrich-administration-believes-obama-superior-pope">Obama <em>is</em> superior to the Pope</a>.</li>
  <li>The reasoning behind the Obama administration’s idea about <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/nuclear-weapons-reduction-obama">reducing the US nuclear force</a> is clear, precise—and correct. We wouldn’t have so many nukes in the first place were it not for the pissing match we got into with the Soviets. Absent an escalating threat, it’s cheaper and safer to keep only a few around. (I still think they’re unjustifiable under Just War criteria, though.)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.chnonline.org/component/content/article/11022-.html">Timsanity!!!</a> Umm, yeah. Eww.</li>
  <li>I have no idea if it’s true, but if <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/media-matters-received-50000-grant-money-to-monitor-religious-media-69706/">Media Matters did get $50,000 to monitor conservative religious news outlets</a>, good on them. The only problem I’d have with it is that they didn’t use some of the money to pay me to write for them.</li>
  <li>Here’s how <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/churches-get-the-word-out-on-new-voter-id-rules-b147p2b-139487808.html">religion and politics</a> interact in a healthy, productive way. The key here is that the churches are helping <em>everyone</em> get their vote in, regardless of party. The more citizens participate in the political conversation, the better, from a moral <em>and</em> political perspective. Saddest part of the story, though? This: Edman also suggested that voters get out their photo IDs before entering the voting room. “In August, a lot of people got up to the table and started looking around for their ID, and that slows things down,” she said.
That’s why they do it. The point of Voter ID laws—and all of the witch hunts against “voter fraud” that Republicans are conducting these days—is to make voting more difficult. The more difficult it is to vote, the fewer people do it, and the better the GOP does, because the restrictions never do seem to hit white middle-class areas as hard as they do poor and minority areas. Like I said, getting out the vote is doing religion and politics the right way. And <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/leaked-documents-detail-operation-angry-badger-u447pp9-139483133.html">this</a> (astroturfing) is not.</li>

            <p>Adele Stan has a new piece at AlterNet talking about how the controversy over <a href="http://www.alternet.org/news/154166/has_obama_exposed_the_powerlessness_of_the_us_bishops/?page=entire">providing birth control for employees in Catholic institutions</a> has exposed fault lines between the bishops and pretty much everybody else. It’s really worth reading to see how tenuous their grip on political power really is. Put it this way: they’re influential because it’s convenient for the media and political elites to maintain the fiction of their influence. They speak for almost no one other than themselves on many issues.</p>

I’ve known <em>plenty</em> of churches who would be happy to turn out the lights, turn down the heat, and do away with “unnecessary expenses” like the pastor’s pay rather than cough up more dough. And the people who have given the same measly $5.00 each week for their entire adult lives will look at you and say, “Why can’t you make some sacrifices for us?”</p>

According to legend, 65 people drowned in a pond trying to kill Blase, plus seven women who were so impressed by his torture that they gathered up his blood and refused to sacrifice it to the Roman gods. Some people will do anything to get out of the house. The women reportedly shed milk rather than blood from their wounds, leading two of their children to exclaim, “leave us not after thee, but right sweet mother, like as thou hast nourished us with thy milk so replenish us with the realm of heaven.” Kids say the darndest things.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>A few years later, the townfolk tried to revive the old show in a barn, but they were only able to martyr 40 Christians. One wonders how hard they were trying. That’s nothing by Broadway standards. Then there were the usual wars and invasions by Tamerlane. About twenty years ago, rioters protesting a humorist’s presence at a conference burned a hotel in Sivas, killing 37 people. Anyone who sees this as evidence of barbarism hasn’t tried to read Larry the Cable Guy’s book. Lately, hardly anyone’s been massacred there, though.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>Blaise lived in a cave, like any self-respecting saint. He also had birds and animals who would come to see him, but they were polite enough to wait until after he was done with his prayers. At our house, they won’t even wait for dinner to be over.</span>  
<span>  
</span></div>
<div><span>One day, a widow told Blaise a wolf was being mean to her little piggy. Well, what would you expect? He had hardly chewed on the pig at all, maybe just a little around the ears and tail as an appetizer. But Blaise asked the to give the little porker back to the widow, and he did. Later the widow slaughtered the pig and brought its head and feet to Blaise in prison. The pig’s reaction to his short-lived reprieve is not recorded, but I’ll bet the wolf was disappointed. The widow also brought Blaise a pair of candles, which became one of his symbols in later years. Oddly, no one seems to have paired them with a pig’s head.</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span>  
<span>Everybody agrees that Blaise ran into trouble in 316, unless it was 387 or 283. Anyway, it was when Agricola was governor of the region and during the fifteen minutes or so when Licinius Augustus controlled Cappadocia and didn’t like Christians. *He* came to a sticky end later in his second civil war against Constantine. Some people just don’t know how to be satisfied with occupying Thrace. Blaise was peacefully avoiding the soldiers in his cave when some hunters stumbled across him and turned him in to the governor. And what, we may ask, were they doing in the woods out of season? Blaise may or may not have been healing wild animals when he was captured. You didn’t hear that from a wolf.</span></div>
<div><span>  
</span>  
<span>While in custody, Blaise was beaten both with and without iron carding combs, which I have to admit is a new one on me. According to Wikipedia,</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p><span>The iron carding combs typically used for torture were sturdy instruments with one or two rows of teeth, each a few inches in length and designed to prepare wool and other fibres for worsted-spun thread. Used for rough fibres, these instruments resembled miniature garden rakes rather than the modern, short-toothed carders that are used to prepare wool for spinning and which resemble brushes for dog grooming.</span></p>

            <p>I took my son to see <a href="http://www.us.movie.tintin.com/">the new Tintin movie</a> tonight. Ever since, I have been struggling to find words to describe how awful it is. I have failed. To equal the task may require me to summon the zombie Dorothy Parker in order to find the suitable put-down. The last time I came away this disappointed in a film was when some friends took me to see <em>Natural Born Killers</em> the night it opened in Washington D.C. When we came out, they asked how I liked it.</p>

They didn’t even know what it was. Who doesn’t know what pita bread is? Finally, they asked the assistant manager who took us right to it. Then they sent me home with a fistful of paper: four long coupons, a receipt, and a statement of my Pig Points.</p>

Soon, we will replace the battered, faithful old thing, which will allow me to remove the books from my church office and consolidate them with the ones currently lining a wall at home.</span></span>

<div><span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: small;">The ins and outs get a bit complicated, but the sum is that this leaves me with a little less storage than before, so I’ve been picking through my old volumes, winnowing them down to fit the space available. It is a task I dread. Some days I think I would rather lose my fingers than my books. But some of these things have been moving around with me since college or before, and I cannot imagine a circumstance that would compel me to read most of them again, short of being locked in the basement for two weeks with nothing else to do. Even so, most of them are readily available online. Assuming my hypothetical basement had internet access, then, I could replace most of them with little trouble. I suppose the cellar would have to have a mail slot as well, which makes it something less than a prison, but you get the point.</span></span>

<div><span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: small;">One of the books I harvested was the script for Carol Reed’s 1949 film *The Third Man,* written by Graham Greene. It has long been a favorite of mine, with Orson Welles at the height of his talent playing Harry Lime, a charming scoundrel trying to hustle a living in the ruins of post-war Vienna. Second banana goes to Joseph Cotten as Rollo Martins, nicknamed “Holly,” a childhood friend who eventually betrays Harry. Alida Valli is Lime’s girlfriend, Anna Schmidt, whom Martins falls for, hard.</span></span></div>

<div><span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: small;">It’s worth seeing, if you haven’t. It is a masterpiece of film noir, filled with hair-raising set pieces, including one on an enormous Ferris wheel, in which Harry pontificates about morality and the shape of Western civilization—all while threatening to throw his friend off the ride:</span></span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p><span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Don’t be so gloomy. After all it’s not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love – they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly.</span></span></p>

            <p>At the risk of complaining about sour grapes, I want to add a few more thoughts about <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/aug/05/changing-the-script-daniel-schultz">Mark Oppenheimer’s review</a> of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Script-Authentically-Progressive-Political/dp/1935439146"><em>Changing the Script</em></a> in the Guardian. In my view, the “ideological axe” Oppenheimer has to grind has to do with sustaining the prevailing narrative about religion and politics.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/belief/2010/aug/05/changing-the-script-daniel-schultz">Mark Oppenheimer</a> thinks <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Script-Authentically-Progressive-Political/dp/1935439146"><em>Changing the Script</em></a> plays true to type. I’ll return the favor: his review of the book is stereotypical of elite opinion-makers: tendentious, filled with an ideological axe to grind and an inability to see the forest for the trees.</p>

            <p>I’ve been making this point for a long time now: there is a definite edge to our current state of economic screwdom that takes it beyond the ordinary. I hesitate to call it “spiritual,” because that always makes people’s eyes glaze over. But indeed, there is something about this meltdown that calls for explanations of its meaning in a philosophical or theological sense.</p>

            <p>“Be careful what you wish for,” goes the old saw, “you just might get it.” I’m learning what that’s all about this week. A sneak nor’easter blew through our neck of the woods on Tuesday, and dropped about a foot of snow on us. That was on top of about four or fives inches of the white stuff that we picked up last week—enough, in other words, to shut the place down.</p>

            <p>How can I tell that all is well with the world? Because it’s snowing! It’s been wintry here all week: stiff breezes blew in a chill Sunday afternoon. I sat in the living room late in the day, reading the paper and listening to the windows rattling and the porch chairs being blown around. Monday and Tuesday were bitterly cold by the standards of the lower Susquehanna valley: in the 20’s, with wind gusts making it feel like it was something below zero. I spent a good chunk of the week reminding people that I’m from Wisconsin, and this kind of thing doesn’t faze me. (That’s not quite true. Four years in Atlanta did do something to thin my blood. Still, I don’t really complain until the air temperature approaches zero.) Wednesday was a little better, if a bit damp, and today the wind has at least lifted. It feels like a spring snowstorm to me, the kind we used to get around the time of state basketball championships. I keep catching myself secretly wishing that it would turn out to be a surprise blizzard, like many spring snows are in the upper Midwest. Thirty inches of snow would suit me just about right these days: my fridge is full enough, and this week’s sermon not yet written.</p>

            <p>My mother thinks I have an identity problem. For the life of her, she can’t understand what I see in the Catholic church. She doesn’t mind me wearing a chasuble, which is the big brightly-colored trash bag that priests sometimes wear over their white dresses. She’s used to that, since Pop used to wear one. Still, she remains a bit suspicious. I tried to point out to her that since I was essentially cross-dressing on Sunday anyway, a chasuble didn’t make much difference, but this cut no ice with her. Between that and my fondness for the Kyrie and other Liturgical elements, she’s convinced that I have some issues to work out. The breviary, the Mary candles, the new communion service at Faith church, they all serve to back her up. I don’t know what she’ll make of it when she finds out that I’ve allowed my worship committee hornswaggle me into trying communion wafers.<br />
 Ma? I’m only teasing. You’ve got every right to think that I’ve, er, got a thing about Catholicism.</p>

Despite the play on Charlie Brown’s exasperated exclamation, and despite my admitted sadness at seeing Peanuts go, I don’t really want to talk about grief this week. I’ve had enough of that for a while.</p>

        </h2>
            <p>After a long Thanksgiving weekend filled with good food and small graces, I took another long drive out of the city of Philadelphia on Monday morning. Jen (my traveling companion and sparring partner) had left Philadelphia International at the ridiculous hour of 6:30 a.m., so we’d stayed the night at the Airport Marriott, and walked across the concourse to her gate. After she boarded, I went back to the room and slept a little longer. Along the way, I had to pass through two metal detectors, and set off the second. How I could pass through four in all, and only cause a stir at the fourth, was beyond me. It seemed a bit absurd, particularly since my watch and single piece of change—a quarter—were sitting in the guard’s bucket. Not only that, but I wasn’t even on my way to a gate, just back to the hotel. But I was too tired and groggy to fuss, so I let the guard wave a wand around my butt and tell me that my electronic door lock for the hotel room was setting things off. I put my paper down on the x-ray machine to be scanned, and had to double back for it a minute or two later.<br />
 When I woke up from my nap, I watched a bit of The Last Emperor on the hotel television, then showered and went on my merry way. I had decided to search for a couple of comic book stores on my way out of town, so I drove up Interstate 76 to South Street, and headed for Rittenhouse Square. Sadly, the store I was looking for wasn’t there, and I didn’t want to spend the morning hunting. So I turned the truck around, passed Drexel University on the other side of the freeway, and headed out Lancaster Avenue, reversing the trip we’d made in the night before.<br />
 If you’ve ever traveled the length of Lancaster Avenue, you’ll know what an adventure this was. The foot of the avenue, just to the west of Drexel, has to be one of the worst neighborhoods I’ve ever seen. Ruined houses and steel-shuttered stores lie cheek-by-jowl by junkyards, formal or otherwise, and the decaying infrastructure of a very old metropolitan area. Were it not for the modern-looking electric trolley running down the middle of the street and the Jamaican restaurants, you could mistake the place for London the morning after the first blitz. I’ve never seen so many collapsed houses allowed to stand in one neighborhood. <br />
 As you can imagine, I feel in love with the place immediately. It teemed with life and vitality, and something in me yearned to help reclaim its forgotten corners and rotting buildings. Let’s not get too romantic about it, though. I was scared stiff when some cops steered my line of traffic off the main drag onto a momentary detour through some small, tight side streets. All it takes is one cranky drug dealer, I thought…When I made it back to Lancaster Avenue, I was annoyed almost beyond description by the locals who seemed unable to move down a perfectly clear street without weaving and braking irrationally. Sometimes, they would just stop for no good reason and sit in the middle of the street, blinking and looking around. I finally realized that there must be a different sense of geography here, one not so dependent on yellow lines and the orderly flow of cars to someplace else.<br />
 After a high school, the street took a sharp turn to the right, and within a block, had shifted to a more upscale neighborhood. It seemed like it only took me a few seconds to move from the ghetto to a Main Line suburb, with fenced-in lawns and split-level ranchers predominating. A little further took me past the massive St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Seminary and the more modest Eastern Baptist Seminary across the street. Then it was into Bryn Mawr, with its boutiques and ritzy supermarkets. I can’t complain about them: one of the boutiques was a comic book store where I dropped about sixty bucks, and the local ritzy supermarket was kind enough to take American Express for some deodorant, a new toothbrush, and some Pop Tarts.<br />
 And so it went. Sometimes the Avenue would be a wealthy, almost snobbish district. Around Villanova, I saw more Mercedes and Lexuses than anything. Other times, it was home to American Legion posts and tanning salons. Along the way, I saw a funeral procession with somewhere between 50 and 75 cars. I swear it stretched nearly a mile. Not too far beyond that, the Avenue turned to large, modern condominium complexes and suburban office parks. Two miles later, I passed a Home Depot and turned onto the bypass to Lancaster. It had taken me a little more than an hour of driving to make it from downtown to the fringes of the suburbs. Within half an hour, I was in Amish country in Lancaster county, and by the time my second hour in the truck rolled around, I was well back into the city of Lancaster.<br />
 Despite my dawdling, I was in a hurry to get back to town. I had to go meet with Betty Graham, whose husband Dick had passed away on Sunday. He had prostate cancer that had spread throughout his body: to the bladder, the colon, the lungs. After a two-year battle, he had finally succumbed. I went to see him at the hospice center the night before he died. He had lost ten or fifteen pounds just in the week since I’d last visited with him. His skin had turned orange because some of his internal organs had shut down. He looked like a victim of the Holocaust, and every breath he took sounded painful. I honestly thought he might die while I was in the room. Despite all this, he could still open his eyes and apparently recognize who was speaking to him. So I sat and prayed and talked to him for about half an hour, then kissed his forehead and told him that if he went, he should go in peace. The look he gave me almost defies description: he seemed surprised that I was still there, maybe a little angry that I was leaving. But there was also a distinct note of farewell. He knew we wouldn’t see each other again, and he wanted to say goodbye, even though his tongue no longer worked. I told him not to pinch the nurses, and that I would be by to see him the next afternoon. A parishioner delivered a note in the middle of church, informing me that he had died a few minutes earlier.<br />
 I had spoken with Betty from the hotel, as well as with the polite young funeral director, but nothing really replaces the physical presence of a pastor at a time like this. So I had a quick snack at home—a cup of coffee to ward off a headache and an apple to tide me over till dinnertime—and headed down to the office. I spent an hour there reading through Russ Mitman’s essay on funerals in his excellent Worship Vessels—buy it if you can find it—before heading over to Betty’s house.<br />
 She gave me a big hug when I came in, but said that in all she felt “relieved” that Dick had passed on. He had begun to suffer at the end, and she felt like she could no longer care for him. Better for him to go, she said, than to stay here and be miserable. She wanted to talk about his passing a little, but mainly, we talked about preparations for his service. I showed her what I wanted to do, and checked a few out-of-the-ordinary aspects with her. For example, at the close of the viewing, I wanted the casket to be moved from in front of the altar to the center aisle, so that Dick would essentially join us in the congregation. And rather than wait for everyone to leave before removing the casket, I suggested, why not bring it and the family out first, while the congregation sang one last hymn? Betty was agreeable—as long as I did a good job, I could have a pretty free hand, which I have learned is fairly typical in a situation like this. There was only one difficult part of the whole conversation. I suggested a reading from the Gospel of John to Betty, and read it out loud for her:<br />
Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant be also.<br />
I couldn’t help myself. I broke down and started crying. Betty started to cry too, and reached over to give me another hug. “He was your friend too, wasn’t he?” she said. And he was: we had grown close over the course of a year of visits. He was a wonderful man, and I felt—still feel—lucky to have met him. <br />
 In a way, it seemed outrageous that I should do his funeral on Wednesday. For one thing, I felt like bawling for about half the service. Here the congregation was looking to me for strength and comfort, and I wasn’t completely sure my voice wouldn’t waver when I read the prayers. But that’s part of being a minister, too. We are not supermen, but men (and women) of God. I’m sure God wept at this service, too. I tried to stay as together as I could, but was not shy about telling people that it affected me, too. This was the first time I could honestly say that I was burying a friend, and the responsibility seemed awesome to me. I wanted, simply, to make sure that he got a good send-off. That is the goal for everyone who’s buried from our church, but this time it had a special weight to it. I was keenly aware of the gift of Dick’s friendship—I mean that I felt as though he were a better friend to me than I to him—and it embarrassed, even shamed me a little, to realize that he would have been the first to thank and congratulate me on a job well done whether or not I deserved it. Grace, someone said, isn’t real until you think it’s not rightfully yours.<br />
 The service itself went well, if I do say so myself. The prayers seemed to hit home with people. By the second verse of “How Great Thou Art,” Dick’s stepson Jeff had to rush out, overcome by grief. My sermon was widely ignored (also fairly typical in a situation like this), but tributes from another stepson and two granddaughters were well-received. I heard someone sobbing behind me as one of the young women spoke. The service went longer than I expected—nearly an hour—but it felt complete and worshipful. By the time they rolled the casket out, people were ready to let go and move on, which is the whole point. <br />
 The committal service at the gravesite also went well, despite a sharp cold snap that morning. The undertakers were surprised to see me wearing my robes with no topcoat, but I lied and told them the robes were warmer than they looked. The truth is that I have no overcoat. Jen has already ordered me to look for one. Behind the shelter of the memorial tent, I said a few quick prayers and sprinkled some sand on the coffin. A color guard from the local American Legion came in and folded the flag and presented it to Betty. A bugler sounded “Taps,” but thankfully, there was no twenty-one gun salute. Betty and Dick’s daughters put some roses on the coffin, and then we all hurried back to our cars. The wind cut like a knife, and we were all glad to get back to church for the luncheon.<br />
 It’s been a long time since someone this close to me died. The last time was when my beloved high-school English teacher Mrs. Palmer died about ten years ago. I had forgotten in that time the quietness of what grief does to you, the calm and almost unnoticeable ways it digs into your life. Once in a while, I think about seeing Dick in his coffin. It disturbs me a little that he looked better in death than in the last few days of his life. It still puzzles me that the man I talked to a little less than two weeks ago is now under six feet of dirt and sod, waiting for the worms to take him. I have to stop and think before I remember that I don’t have to go see him this coming Sunday, as had been my habit. I may stop by to see Betty, but we’ll sit out in the living room, not in the sun room at the back of the house, where Dick’s hospital bed was set up in the past few months.<br />
 Most of all—and this is why I brought up my exodus through Lancaster Avenue—it confounds me to think that Dick is now committed solely to our memories. It struck me as I traveled along that single by-way that it takes a tremendous amount of memory to capture even the buildings of a single street. How to adequately describe the hundreds of shops, houses, apartment buildings, malls, hospitals, seminaries, train stops, parks, office buildings, ruins along those few miles? And if this is just one street that I have seen, how much more is stored away up there? Should I begin to wax eloquent about Franklin Avenue in the Twin Cities? Peachtree Street in Atlanta? Monroe Street or Williamson in Madison Wisconsin, my hometown? And how many more streets and roads had Dick seen in his years of rambling across the country? Yet now all his memories were gone, consigned to the ground and the afterlife. It seemed less sad than strange, having come fresh from a weekend of accumulating good memories, to realize that at some point, we lose our memory and in that very moment become nothing more than a figment of someone else’s. I wondered if someone would look back on their deathbed and see an image of me walking down some random avenue, as I had seen people walking in Philadelphia. Is that what becomes of us? I thought. Will we live on in memory, and there alone?<br />
 Well, and what of it? Eternal life consists in being fondly remembered by one’s friends and family, said Martin Buber. What could better? he asked. I don’t know. I just hope that when I die, I am remembered as fondly as Dick Graham was.</p>

            <p>Be brief this week. It’s been a long one, and you’re tired. Nothing serious, nothing that twelve hours of sleep and an ice cream sundae wouldn’t fix. But still, it’s been a week, and you least of anybody need to hear yourself go off on some enormous flight of fancy this Thursday. So stick to the message, don’t answer any pop questions on the leadership of Pakistan, and for God’s sake, don’t discuss any youthful indiscretions without talking to your handlers first.</p>

            <p>It’s happened again. I had every intention of writing my sermon today, long before deadline. The church has a new secretary, which makes life easier: she affords me the luxury of at least thinking that for once, my sermon will be done early. Dreams of luxury seldom take realities of laziness into account, however. I allowed myself to get side-tracked onto working on a chart of church giving over the past year. Despite my very limited math skills, I’m convinced that if I just stare at the charts for a little while longer, I’ll find something better to say than “we need more people in church each week if we’re going to meet the budget.” So I wasted a good two or three hours that might have been more profitably devoted to writing the sermon. Procrastination is an art form unto itself, however, and if we don’t soon figure out what to do about the budget, I may not have a call to write sermons for anymore. On the other hand, the best advice I’ve gotten on the subject is to let faith lead the growth in both people and money, so maybe I’d better get down to that sermon after all…</p>

            <p>Oh boy, will I ever get some mail on this one. The thought occurred to me the other day on my way to see my pastoral counselor that I have been in a kind of grieving process ever since my ministry began back in January. I don’t know where these thoughts come from. Probably it’s best just to say that it’s a long, empty road between Lancaster and Harrisburg, and to leave it at that.</p>

            <p>It’s been a rough week around the ranch. The kind of week when you’re not quite sure who’s getting fixed, the critters or you. The kind of week when an old cowhand would just prefer to sleep in—except the horse needs fed, the cows are ready to get a move on, and the pardners have already run two cattledrives and eaten a bowl of chili by the time you get up. As if that weren’t enough, those damn bluebirds of happiness insist on singing at dawn. It’s been the kind of week where your eyeballs just won’t focus anymore, your joints ache, and your stomach has that queasy feeling: what next? The kind of week where it occurs to you that sleep deprivation has become more a way of life than an occasional hurdle. That kinda rough week.</p>

            <p>My mother likes to tell my brothers and I that we are descended from “moody Danes.” Her most immediate reference is to our propensity for depression and melancholy, but there are other reasons as well. Until recently, we were all bachelors, for example. If we were only farmers, we would fit in perfectly with our old-world Lutheran heritage. We all take after our Danish ancestors physically, as well. Peter looks the most like our Danish grandfather, but we all are tall and stocky, our skin is fair, and our hair runs from a strawberry blond to a light brown. We are all serious thinkers in our own way. I suppose I am the most philosophical, but the others are sober, contemplative men in their own right. None of us are particularly good at talking to women we don’t know, which is the mark of a good Scandinavian man wherever in the world he might be found. Well, all right, Jon has always been a bit of a charmer, but I think he inherited that from the tiny sliver of Irish ancestry remaining in our blood.</p>

            <p>Shhh…don’t tell anyone. I have a confession to make. Sometimes I feel like a fake. Sometimes I don’t feel like I’m half the minister I ought to be. Too loud, too obnoxious, too secular a boy to be anything more than one of the more confused souls out in the pews. Sometimes, I feel like I don’t deserve the love and respect I get from my girlfriend. Too shy, too nervous, too reluctant to join any club that would have me to collect her kisses and phone calls. Sometimes, I feel just like a big old dumb slob. My house is a mess, my office is buried under a stack of unread mail, and there’s about six serious books piled up on a bookshelf in my spare bedroom waiting for me to crack their covers.</p>

            <p>The people have spoken. The consensus is that I am to abandon all pastoral issues in this column in favor of extensive coverage of professional wrestling. I have to admit that the career change might have some hidden benefits to it: I could pass off my girth as protective camouflage, for example. And I feel somewhat prepared for the new role, as well. It is true that I lived in Minnesota while Jesse “The Body” Ventura was but the mayor of a small and insignificant suburb, and it is true that while I lived in Minnesota, I hung out with Karl Von Raschke, the son of the notorious Crusher, the Baron Von Raschke. That man could kill you with one hand! Also, I have seen Hulk Hogan’s wretched TV show, “Thunder in Paradise,” at least once. That alone ought to qualify me for a position as a wrestling commentator of certifiably intellectual stature. Well, <em>certifiable</em> intellectual stature, anyway.</p>

            <p>Praise God from whom all blessings flow! I have been wondering when I would luck into a good story in Pennsylvania; there seems to be plenty to reflect on here, but not much to report directly. It’s almost like watching a stream cut through a barren desert plain: there’s water, but the grass is never green. When I lived in Atlanta, the stories would practically accost me—come to my door looking for a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich, or latch on to me at a convenience store and offer to play matchmaker—sometimes they would even get violent, as when I cracked up a Honda on the local freeway. But something’s different here in Lancaster. So far, the crackheads have stayed away from the front porch; the local grocers barely notice me, let alone offer to set me up with a Korean girl; my truck is still in one piece. <em>Inshallah</em>, these trends will continue.</p>

            <p>Before introducing some new and bizarre topic to A Pastor’s Notebook, it might be helpful to pause for a moment and take stock of how the columns have been going up to this point. Over the eight weeks or so that APN has been running, two sets of feedback worth responding to have developed—one serious, one less so.</p>

            <p>It’s shaping up to be a long, hot week. Actually, the weather’s okay: sunny, dry, highs in the upper 80’s. But the church is heating up once again, for a variety of reasons that discretion forbids me to discuss. No complaints, though. I’ve done quite enough venting here lately.</p>

            <p>First it was the smooth, daring, magisterial brass of John Coltrane’s The Africa Sessions. “Song of the Underground Railroad,” “Greensleeves,” “Africa.” It may have only made to the boombox playlist three or four times, but I carried the sound with me wherever I went for the better part of a month.</p>

            <p>Honest, I did have more responses to my duck dilemma this week. It’s just that, of the three I wanted to share, one needed to be summarized rather than printed verbatim, one got lost, and one survives.</p>

            <p>I was about to set off in a brave new direction this week when that duck got me pinned down. I have so much mail on his behalf that I feel obliged to clear the decks, as it were, and dispose of him before I move on to other, greener pastures. Or at least fields more theological than avian.</p>

            <p>Let’s play a game. I’ll pretend to be a young pastor with a writing jones that just won’t quit, a funnybone that’s aching to be tickled, and a desperate need to do something, anything, to distract himself from the anxieties of ministry. You pretend to be an interested, friendly group of readers who would welcome insightful, humorous writing from a deeply spiritual perspective. Then pretend that you’re willing to read what I send you anyway.</p>
